# 7-day-cloud-youtube-starterkit

So you want to start your own cloud/dev YouTube channel? I've collected all my learnings and experience from [building my own](https://youtube.com/madebygps) into this repo. My goal is to get you from zero to first video published in 7 days, and then for you to have everything you need to keep the momentum going. I believe in you, and I hope you do to.

Also, I'll update this whenever I have more info to share :)

## How do I use this repo?

I've setup the format so you can start any day, and take it day by day, until you publish your first video, committing about 2 hours a day (depending on your skill level, could be longer or shorter), and 1 rest day before you repeat the process, which is day 7.

| Day | Task            | Time commitment        |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------|
| [0](start-here/README.md)   | Make sure this repo is for you  | 10 minutes                |
| [1](day1/README.md)   | Research topic  | 3 hours                |
| [2](day2/README.md)   | Write script    | 2 hours                |
| [3](day3/README.md)   | Practice script | 2 hours                |
| [4](day4/README.md)   | Record          | 1 hour                 |
| [5](day5/README.md)   | Edit            | 1 hour                 |
| [6](day6/README.md)   | Publish         | 30 min                 |
| [7](day7/README.md)   | Rest            | as much as you need :) |

Each day will have a guide and a worksheet. I've made the worksheets as abstract as possible, so you can continue using them as you go and customize them to your needs. Remember, making a video is way more about planning and getting your idea down, than actually recording and editing.

Each guide will contain tips and tricks to help you with the tasks of the day. These guides are the ones I'll most likely update as I learn new things.
