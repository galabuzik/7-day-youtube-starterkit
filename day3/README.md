# Day 3: Practice the script

Time to write the script. How detailed your scripts are is up to you. At the beginning my scripts contained word by word what I was going to say. Now I can get away with only bullet points. Up to you.

- **Time commitment:** You'll need about 1 - 2 hours for this.

- **Tools you'll need:** The same notes you used in the first and second days.

## Goal of this Day

Practice your script and become comfortable with the material.

## Steps

### 1. Practice the demo

I usually practice the demo first because it's the longest part. I'll have the script open on my laptop screen and then what I'm working on on my external monitor. I'll do this a few times, go through the entire demo.

Pay attention to how you feel and what you sound like. The first time you might sound robotic, but that gets better with each try. You'll start to notice where you want to take a pause, where you might want to add/remove a word or so. This is up to you. Just make sure you update your script with the changes.

> **Action step:** Go practice your demo at least twice.

### 2. Practice the intro and the conclusion

Since these are shorter sections, I would advise to practice these a few more times. I also think these sections are great places to connect with your audience a little more. When you're recording your demo, you can have your script opened on another screen outside of your recording area and sort of use it as a cheat sheet if you forget something. In your intro and conclusion, you can't do this, since you're recording yourself and not the screen. You could use a teleprompter, but personally I think that's excessive.

With these sections, act like you're on a zoom with a friend. Allow yourself to be yourself, that's what connects with the people. If you talk with your hands, allow that to be part of your video. If you smile a lot, allow that to be part of your video.

Aim for you intro to tell the viewer EXACTLY what they are going to get out of your video and it's also a good time to remind them to like and subscribe :)

I've been defining my own intros and have settled on [this style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBuG_SazpNo) ends at 1:20.

> **Action step:** Go practice your intro and conclusion, at least 3 times.

### 3. That's it

Go take a break and move on to the next day whenever you're ready :)
